        <h1>Post Brexit impact to Commercial Real Estate Sector - the experts insights</h1>
        <p style="color:#1e5aa0; font-weight:bold">Date: Wednesday 31st January 2018        Venue: The RDS - Dublin</p>
        <p>The Commercial real estate sector has witnessed a dramatic turnaround in the last 3 years. Foreign Inward investment continues at pace, unemployment is now approaching an historic low and the opportunity presented by BREXIT suggests the sector will continue to grow strongly in the next two years.</p> 
        <p>To realise this potential we are faced with many challenges central to which is the continuing poor pace of change within our Banking sector coupled with  the never before seen housing crisis. The 2018 summit will  bring together business leaders, professional advisors and all key stakeholders in the Irish commercial real estate sector to robustly debate and challenge the policy makers who influence the shape of tomorrows property sector. The summit will be an opportunity to question industry leaders on how best to maximise the potential of Irelands real estate sector</p>
